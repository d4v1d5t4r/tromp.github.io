Which scores are finishes?
</H2>
One can throw 36, 40, or 50 plus any triple up to 120, and
these numbers are 0, 1, and 2 modulo 3 respectively.
In a picture:
<PRE>
           ... 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170
triple+36       *           *           *
triple+40           *           *           *           *
triple+50               *           *           *           *           *           *           *

finishes:  ... 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158     160 161         164         167         170

How many possible 9-darter games are there?
</H2>
This seems rather dificult to count until we start to distinguish cases
based on final double and minimum of the first 8 darts.
The 50,50 entry for instance is calculated as
<PRE>
( 8 )   (  8  )   ( 8 )
(2 1) + (2 1 1) + (3 2) = 168+840+560 = 1568.


  \dbl     24    30    34    36    40    50
min\       --------------------------------
34                                       56
40                                      672
45                            8
48                           56
50                     56         672  1568
51                8         224
54               56         448
57          8    56          56
</PRE>
Giving a grand total of 3944 possible 9-darters, as confirmed in
<a href="http://www.math.unimaas.nl/events/mmm/mmm10/3m04-darts.pdf">this
report</a>, which also states the number of essentially different
solutions (as a multi-set of first 8 dart scores) as 22.
<P>
Note that a finishing double of e.g. 38 is not possible, as there
is no way to partition 501-8*60-38 = -17 into the numbers
-3, -6, -9, -10, -12, and -15.
<P>
In practice you'll only see 9-darters starting with two 180s,
leaving a 141 finish. The number of ways to finish 141 is calculated similarly:
<PRE>
  \dbl     24    30    34    36    40    50
min\       --------------------------------
34                                        2
40                                        2
45                            2
48                            2
50                      2           2
51                2           2
54                2
57          2

That's 20 ways.

<H2>
What is the most impressive 9-darter?
</H2>
That would be throwing three 167 "finishes" in a row, repeating triple 20, triple 19, and bulls eye.
The bulls eye is much harder to hit than any triple, and a 9-darter can include at most three of them.
I will likely never witness that in my lifetime, but then who could have imagined all of these incredible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jod15uXDMOE">rarities</a>?
